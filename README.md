A small, fast and scalable state-management solution using simplified flux principles.

## Installation
### Swift Package Manager
```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/to4iki/Store", from: <#version#>)
```

## Usage
Store provides a simple and intuitive API for state management, inspired by Zustand.

### Basic Example
First, define your state and actions:

```swift
import Store

struct CounterFeature {
  struct State: Sendable {
    var count: Int = 0
  }

  struct Action {
    let increment: () -> Void
    let decrement: () -> Void
    let reset: () -> Void
  }

  @MainActor
  func useStore() -> (store: Store<State>, action: Action) {
    createStore(initialState: State()) { set in
      Action(
        increment: {
          set { $0.count += 1 }
        },
        decrement: {
          set { $0.count -= 1 }
        },
        reset: {
          set { $0.count = 0 }
        }
      )
    }
  }
}
```

Then use it in your SwiftUI view:

```swift
import SwiftUI

struct CounterView: View {
  @State private var store: Store<CounterFeature.State>
  private let action: CounterFeature.Action

  init() {
    let feature = CounterFeature()
    let (store, action) = feature.useStore()
    self._store = State(initialValue: store)
    self.action = action
  }

  var body: some View {
    VStack(spacing: 20) {
      Text("Count: \(store.state.count)")
        .font(.title)

      HStack(spacing: 16) {
        Button("‚àí") { action.decrement() }
        Button("Reset") { action.reset() }
        Button("+") { action.increment() }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Middleware
Middleware provides a way to extend Store with additional functionality. Think of middleware as a pipeline that wraps around state updates - each middleware can inspect the current state, modify the update process, or perform side effects like logging.

### Using Middleware
Add middleware to your store by passing them to the `middlewares` parameter:

```swift
let (store, action) = createStore(
  initialState: CounterFeature.State(),
  middlewares: [SimplePrintMiddleware<CounterFeature.State>()]
) { set in
  // ... action definitions
}
```

## Slices
Slices allow you to modularize your state management by breaking down large stores into smaller, focused units that can be composed together. This is particularly useful for complex applications where different parts of the state need to be managed independently but can also interact with each other.

### Basic Example
Define individual slices by implementing the `Slice` protocol:

```swift
import Store

struct FishSlice: Slice {
  struct State: Sendable {
    var fishes: Int = 0
  }

  struct Action {
    let addFish: () -> Void
  }

  func create(_ set: StateSet<State>) -> (state: State, action: Action) {
    let state = State()
    let action = Action(
      addFish: {
        set { $0.fishes += 1 }
      }
    )
    return (state, action)
  }
}

struct BearSlice: Slice {
  struct State: Sendable {
    var bears: Int = 0
  }

  struct Action {
    let addBear: () -> Void
  }

  func create(_ set: StateSet<State>) -> (state: State, action: Action) {
    let state = State()
    let action = Action(
      addBear: {
        set { $0.bears += 1 }
      }
    )
    return (state, action)
  }
}
```

Use `createStoreWithSlices` to combine multiple slices and add cross-slice actions:

```swift
struct BearFishFeature {
  typealias State = CombinedState<FishSlice.State, BearSlice.State>
  typealias Action = CombinedAction<FishSlice.Action, BearSlice.Action, CrossAction>

  struct CrossAction {
    let eatFish: () -> Void
  }

  @MainActor
  func useStore() -> (store: Store<State>, action: Action) {
    createStoreWithSlices(FishSlice(), BearSlice()) { set in
      CrossAction(
        eatFish: {
          set { state in
            if state.fishes > 0 {
              state.fishes -= 1
              state.bears += 1
            }
          }
        }
      )
    }
  }
}
```

Then use it in your SwiftUI view:

Access both individual slice properties and cross-slice actions through `@dynamicMemberLookup`.

```swift
struct BearFishView: View {
  @State private var store: Store<BearFishFeature.State>
  private let action: BearFishFeature.Action

  init() {
    let feature = BearFishFeature()
    let (store, action) = feature.useStore()
    self._store = State(initialValue: store)
    self.action = action
  }

  var body: some View {
    VStack {
      Text("üêü Fishes: \(store.state.fishes)")
      Text("üêª Bears: \(store.state.bears)")

      HStack {
        Button("Add Fish") { action.addFish() }
        Button("Add Bear") { action.addBear() }
        Button("Bear Eats Fish") { action.eatFish() }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
